## CLIP Search Webpage
This website allows visitors to directly access neurons contained in the convolutional neural network (CNN) Resnet-50. Webpage can be found [here](https://dr4nx.github.io/clip-search/index.html).

Users can either search through individual neurons or by searching various concepts (e.g. stripes, blue, zebra). The webpage will then return that neuron's top activating images and those images' similarity to different concepts.

Website coded in standard HTML/CSS/JS.

Special thanks to teammates Alex Battikha, Atri Pandya, supervisor Professor Lily Weng, and mentor Tuomas Oikarinen.
