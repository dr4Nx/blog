## Dreams
We all have dreams, literally[^1], and in terms of our future, which I'm talking about here. Sometimes these dreams are lofty and pure, like childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut or a doctor or a firefighter or something cool in general. As we get into our high school years, these dreams get broken into pieces, not quite shattered, but with more immediate and pressing issues; for example, getting into college.

For many CS nerds, myself included, perhaps one of these dreams is getting into MIT. It turns out I am not the right person for MIT. And perhaps MIT was never quite the right institution for me. But for me, as it does for many, MIT represents the pinnacle of what is possible in human society. It represents the best of the best, the cutting-edge - it's the school everyone knows about when it comes to technological things across the world. It feels like everyone who does anything engineering related wants to get in[^2]. That's just how it is.

So for me, whether it was my own dream or one created for me, MIT was on the top of my college lists. I really do feel I put a solid effort into the application, and I had a lot of good news to report on the February update form. Alas, it wasn't enough; I was simply not admitted in the end. That dream has ended for now; to be honest, no tears were shed over that result. I had gotten into plenty of good, competitive schools already - Georgia Tech, UIUC, Purdue - but MIT simply added to a long list of private schools that simply did not admit me.

I guess I'm not a private school kid. At the end of the application cycle, I had applied to around ten private schools. Zero ended up offering me admission. None of those schools had anything remotely close to a *high* acceptance rate, but I did think I had a shot at one or two - apparently I was wrong in this assumption.

It's funny. At the beginning of senior year, I had a discussion with someone older and more knowledgable about my college options - they told me that while they didn't really see me as "quirky" or "hands-on" enough to be a MIT or Caltech student, they could really see me joining the Berkeley EECS program; in fact, they said they would put money on that being where I would end up if they were to do such a thing. Turns out, they should have.

To be clear, I'm very happy about where I am. I'm very fortunate to be joining one of the best programs America has to offer, at a discount (being in-state). It just seems a little bit ruthless to just have your college predicted long before you've even started bashing out your first supplemental essay or completed the Common App. Again, not mad about that; just slightly strange that such a thing can be the case.

## HMMT
Anyways, enough about the clown fiesta that is college admissions. HMMT is definitely one of the most defining experiences I've had in high school; whether that be 2023 HMMT or 2024 HMMT. Both of them have their merits. 

I think HMMT is part of the reason I actually like MIT, and also part of the reason why I see I'm not the right fit[^3]. I had some crazy experiences while there; walking through random tunnels on campus (potentially unauthorized). Eating fish and chips, in Boston. Staying up in the hotel lobby until 5 in the morning, eating pizza ordered at 1 am, singing to random songs, witnessing a teammate call the suicide hotline because he was curious about life(?), and watching a different teammate make a makeshift bed on the floor. Falling asleep during a guest lecture 4 hours later because, duh. Also, being told my hotel neighbor that I would get the cops called on me after my friends were being loud, and then we left the room, and then I went back to the room to grab a cookie and of course I'm alone so I'm the one getting yelled at.

Perhaps my mistake is not realizing that I can have those types of experiences at not MIT (wow, crazy I know). Perhaps the fact that I had those experiences specifically at MIT, and not anywhere else (since I didn't have the opportunity to) led to this incorrect association. After Nats and M3C, this notion cooled significantly. But simply, MIT had a vibe that was... slightly off from what I was comfortable with. It was just a little too much for me.

## Looking Ahead
I'm starting college in a week, which is honestly crazy to even think about; it feels like the past few years have just blown by, even though they really haven't. I'll hopefully be continuing this blog in college, maybe with some more technical and project related stuff too :). Maybe even some yapping about poker! Exciting times are ahead. I look forward to it.


[^1]: Apologies if you don't.
[^2]: Of course, this isn't true. I have many engineering friends who didn't even bother putting in an application.
[^3]: Or this is just me coping cause I'm not good enough :')
