## Mementos
Competitive math has been a core part of my identity for as long as I can remember, up until my last days in high school. During my second semester as a senior, already beginning to feel some of the effects of senioritis, I had an unusual opportunity to recount my mathematics experiences - an assignment in my Advanced Topics in Mathematics class. It was an interesting exercise, and oddly satisfying. It felt relieving, in a way, to just sum up my life experiences. 

As I transition from my last day in high school to my first day in college, I'm simply hoping to save some of my identity from my younger years, to both "wrap them up" as well as come back and see how much I've changed since. I do not expect this to be well written, much like my college applications (given my stellar private school acceptance rate - zero). But unlike those, this will be all me. Additionally, I haven't written something I've wanted to write all on my own in a while. I'm hoping that something like this will help me learn more about myself, even if I don't end up continuing it.

Depending on how many I end up writing, some of these will be about specific experiences, while others, like this one, will be about general parts of my identity during childhood.

## Beginnings
I got my first taste of competition math in around the third grade, starting with [MOEMS](https://moems.org/). In fact, I still have the book that introduced me to the concept of competitive math; Math Olympiad Contest Problems, Volume 1. Diving even more specifically, I remember struggling for a long time on this particular problem, part of Olympiad 1:

> In a stationary store, pencils have one price and pens have another price. Two pencils and three pens cost 78&#162;. But three pencils and two pens cost 72&#162; How much does one pencil cost?</p>
> &#8212; <cite>This problem is left as an exercise to the reader.</cite>

For some reason, this is just one of those "core memories" that exist in my brain (alongside many others). It also serves as the beginning for a near decade-long journey into mathematics, one with many twists and turns, and a lot of self-reflection.

## Elementary and Middle School
It turns out that I wasn't actually too bad at this competitive math thing. I performed reasonably well in the [AMC 8](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_8), [Math Kangaroo](https://mathkangaroo.org/mks/), and the aforementioned MOEMS (including a perfect score in 6th grade, go me I guess?). Even in elementary school, math became a "top thing" for me, along with programming (which I turned out to be both less interested and less proficient in). 

Elementary school, however, wasn't what got me locked into competitive math; that happened in 7th grade. Somehow, I managed to qualify for the [AIME](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/American_Invitational_Mathematics_Examination), having only taken one [AMC 10](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/AMC_10) (I hadn't had the time to sign up for the other). That was the first time I seriously considered that I had a chance at this thing. That June, an excited 7th grade me went on a trip with 60 other students to the University of Nevada in Las Vegas for [ARML](https://arml3.com/), an experience I cherish. One reason why is, though I didn't know it, is that I would never get to go on a trip as a competitor in that contest again. 

## COVID and Burnout(?)
That isn't to say that I didn't participate in ARML ever again; I just did it online, or at UCSD rather than getting to go on a multi-day-trip. 

It is commonly suggested that the COVID pandemic, and the online learning that came with it, has stunted student's learning and growth. Personally, I find the start of the pandemic, combined with the release of the hit video games [VALORANT by Riot Games](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/), and [Among Us](https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/) to lead to very little learning done on my part. This affected not just competitive math (as I may discuss later), but it definitely hit my motivation to learn hard, especially when it comes to math. 

Of course, there is no one really to blame for that but myself. Maybe I never actually had the full intrinsic motivation for math, instead pressured by those around me to keep going. Or perhaps I received too much Internet freedom too fast, and by using it to play a ridiculous amount of Minecraft and VALORANT[^1], I had a loss of passion for other things, including math. I learned a lot about myself during this time, whether I knew it or not.

Whatever happened, I still pursued math into high school. I joined Math Team during freshman year. I was still competitive and kept doing contests. The main difference lied in that I stopped being passionate about learning new topics, theorems, and the like; math almost felt forced on me in some regards.

## High School (In-Person)
In high school, I became a lot less interested in the math part of Math Team and more interested in the team part. I became underclassmen representative, then treasurer, then president[^2]. I admit I was much more excited by the organization of events like [CCAMB](https://ccamb.org/) and organizing trips rather than doing things like writing the problems or taking part in those trips (as my fellow officers know all too well). The positions I had mattered a lot less than I cared about them at the time; it was mainly being able to be part of the organization and decision-making process that made me happiest.

There's not too much to say about my competitive performance, other than that it was largely mediocre (for my standards, at least). I forgot to divide (or multiply) by 2 in 10th grade, resulting in an almost USAJMO qualification. I forgot what a symmedian was in 12th grade, resulting in an almost USAMO qualification. I also slowly lost interest in other travel competitions, except for [HMMT](https://www.hmmt.org/) and [M3C](https://m3challenge.siam.org/) (to be discussed in future posts).

What's interesting is that, for the most part, I no longer care about these results, even just a year later. Time has truly washed away the expectation and stress that came with it; part of it, perhaps, is being completely done with the college application process. Part of the reason why I found HMMT and M3C so fun was that, especially in senior year, there was nothing riding on my results.

## So What?
I pretty much just went over my entire competitive math story[^3]. I'll be making edits to this post, as currently it is in Draft #1. I think if there's anything to take away from my story, it's to not to fall into the sunk cost fallacy, and to make changes when they are needed. While I'll never know, I might've enjoyed something like robotics, science fair projects, or even business, more in high school instead of math. Who knows?

For whoever reads this, don't be afraid to take that shot in the dark. It is very clich√©, but it is (probably) true. Doing something new might be the change you never knew you needed.

Yet, we have but one life to live (or give for our country). It's unlikely that I'll pursue competitive math further in college, other than for personal amusement. That part of my identity has seemed to shrink into almost nothingness. But pursuing competitive math has taught me important lessons that I will carry with me. It has taught me the importance of consistency (as I was not). It has taught the importance of true motivation and passion. It has taught me competitiveness, collaboration, and most importantly, a way of approaching problems that I would be hard pressed to forget. It has taught me critical thinking, persistence, looking outside the box (aka cheesing problems), and most importantly, it has taught me the beauty of what math on its own can create. And that, beyond any regrets I may have about choosing this path, is wonderful.
