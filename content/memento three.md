## Writing Papers
For those that do not know this challenge, the Mathworks Math Modeling Challenge is an international[^1] competition with about 650 teams (in 2024) of up to 5 students competing. These teams work for **fourteen consecutive hours** (a whole day) to write an up to 20 page scientific paper (excluding code and citations) on a problem, usually ingrained in the real world, utilizing math models (who could've guessed). These math models are supposed to project how certain aspects of the project theme will behave in the future. Students additionally must defend their models, providing justifications for assumptions made and explaining the though process in addition to the results of the model. Only upperclassmen (11th/12th graders) are allowed to participate.

9 lucky teams make it to the Finals, a (nearly) all-expenses paid trip to New York City. In addition to this, students are guarenteed a scholarship for college, up to 20000 dollars for first place (4000 per student). 

I participated in the 2023 and 2024 competitions. In 2023, my first competition year, my team did not make it past the second round, where three judges grade the paper. In 2024, my team went to the Finals, one of the biggest surprises I could have never asked for.

## Why Surprise?
One should expect that I was aiming to be a finalist. Obviously, I was aiming for that, but I never expected it to happen; personally, I don't think I put as much effort into the competition that I think should warrant a finalist status. My team and I never spent any time working on past problems; the extent of my pre-competition research was meticulously copying potential models to use in the actual competition.

Apparently though, that was enough. A seemingly for-fun[^2] competition has suddenly become one of my greatest high school achievements.

## The Competition Experience
Fourteen hours may seem like a lot of time. Unfortunately, the time is not often spent particularly well. One of the tricky parts of competition is that there are three seperate parts to each year's problem, and dividing teammates or time among these problems is quite tricky. In addition, 20 pages isn't a small number. 

I won't go much over the 2023 experience; mainly, we didn't really do well becauase we invested way too much time on the first part of the problem, leading to a lack of time spent on the other two parts. Inexperience (the entire team consisted of juniors) cost us quite a bit.

In 2024, we didn't repeat the mistakes we made before. One thing I did that particularly helped was that I templated out the entire paper before we actually even knew the problem; the papers are supposed to be in a specific format anyway, and I think that inherently knowing what we were supposed to do made the team a lot more productive. Planning ahead really does help.

That isn't to say the team was perfectly productive; in fact, we were pretty far from productive. Especially me. I spent a non-trivial amount of time watching an ongoing robotics competition; and it's not particularly possible for anyone to work 14 hours straight (i.e. 8AM to 10PM for context). At some point, everybody on the team got distracted. The overall consequence of this is that we spent the last 10 minutes of competition time frantically copying down citations (and we didn't even complete this task)[^3].

Needless to say, the paper had plenty of flaws. Apparently though, it was good enough for us to be a top 6 team in the whole contest.

## Finals
Everyone on the team joked about making it to the Finals. Nobody expected those jokes to become reality.

The news came in the form of an email, on a lazy Saturday. For me, it came first in the form of a teammate saying:

> GUYS\
> WE WON\
> HOLY COW

From there, preperation became a blur: panicking over how certifiably mid our solution appeared to us[^4], figuring out our presentation and hours spent practicing, navigating interviews with local news networks that we didn't even ask for, and planning with our math teacher, our coach[^5]. One of the funnier anecdotes from this time period is that my sister's English teacher, of all people, knew that I was off to New York. It appears that my math teacher might've done a little bit of talking :).

Soon though, we were off to New York, with plane tickets that we didn't pay for.

Some highlights from the trip:

1. Dinner with former Math Team alumni. This included people now working at quant companies, startups - the whole gamut. They gave us some solid advice[^6], and we had some amazing dinner in Chinatown.
2. Visiting literally every single tourist trap in NYC. Ok, not all of them, but we visited all of the following: The Met, The Brooklyn Bridge, 9/11 memorial, Times Square, High Line, Central Park, Chinatown, Wall Street, Flatiron and probably some other attraction I forgot about.
3. Had New York pizza! And also some really good Italian pasta (Eataly)
4. Displaying a giant chart showing a Linear Regression model which *very evidently* had a pattern in the residual but we ignore that! And then we tried (not sure if we succeeded)[^7] to argue the pattern was not very relevant.
5. Played a lot of JackBox and getting bullied for... not sure what exactly. Just my team likes to bully me :( I am also apparently a really bad liar.
6. A lot of New York subway. We went on so many different lines!
7. Fancy van for the trips to/from the hotel!
8. Met some super cool British dudes and asked why they have an accent (they asked why I had one).
9. Won five thousand dollars! Not first, second, or third but still cool to try for a bigger prize and present our work :)
10. Being known as part of the 'red tie' team. Our ties were in fact bright red.
11. Getting to be teams spokesperson. Pretty useless role, but cool I guess?
12. Getting to see the Jane Street trading floor! (and cafeteria)

## Final Thoughts
For those curious, our paper (and the commentary!) is public on the website [here](https://m3challenge.siam.org/wp-content/uploads/FINALIST_17895.pdf). Feel free to laugh at every spelling or grammatical error made.

I think M3C at its core is misunderstood as a competition about creating the 'best' math model. This is not possible within a fourteen hour timespan. The reason I think our paper succeeded is because while we didn't come up with the most complex model or even the most accurate one, we came up with a model that matched the data and then *defended* it. Whether this was with justified assumptions about the future or how it matched previous data, the most important was acknowledging where our model succeeds and where it fails. This, I think, helps the judges understand our reasoning.

I'm grateful that I got the opportunity to visit New York (on someone else's dime no less). I hope many more students will get similar opportunities in the years to come :)


[^1]: Caveat: Only the United States + United Kingdom (yes, just those two countries), but technically an international group of nations.

[^2]: In fact my parents questioned why I was even doing this contest in the first place, other than to have fun with friends.

[^3]: Our paper actually still contains the words [citation needed] even in the version that was posted to the [M3 website](https://m3challenge.siam.org/wp-content/uploads/FINALIST_17895.pdf).

[^4]: Our solutions to the first two parts were, respectively, linear regression, and multivariate linear regression. I wish I was joking. [I am not](https://m3challenge.siam.org/wp-content/uploads/FINALIST_17895.pdf).

[^5]: Note, and he acknowledges this so he probably won't care if I say it: the coach doesn't really do anything other than exist as an adult point of contact.

[^6]: A memorable question: "So, are you guys still virgins?" - asked to 5 CS males. (This was asked in front of a math teacher, by the way)

[^7]: Trying to argue that linear regression is a valid modeling system to dudes and gals with PhDs in mathematics is not exactly what one would describe as a fun activity.
