Hi! I'm Evan. I'm a student at UC Berkeley, originally from San Diego, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the College of Engineering. I'm interested in math, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy working out, enjoying the outdoors, playing video games, and drawing whales.

I've previously been involved in [CyberPatriot](../memento-two), [math competitions](../memento-one), and [artificial intelligence research](https://dr4nx.github.io/clip-search/index.html).

You can reach out to me at [evan-luo@berkeley.edu](mailto:evan-luo@berkeley.edu).
