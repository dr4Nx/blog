Hi! I'm Evan. I'm a student at UC Berkeley, originally from San Diego, majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the College of Engineering. I'm interested in math, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy working out, enjoying the outdoors, playing video games, and drawing whales.

I've previously been involved in CyberPatriot, math competitions, and artificial intelligence research.
