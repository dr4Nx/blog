  <div class="post-content"><h2 id="cybersecurity-and-me">Cybersecurity and Me</h2>
<p>While I might not know it now, cybersecurity might define (or even be) my future. While I dont exactly <em>plan</em> on pursuing cybersecurity in college (and beyond), it's not an interest that will suddenly disappear. </p>
<p>I didn't know it then, but when I joined my first CyberPatriot club meeting as a sophomore, it would come to define my high school future. Here's where I was at: zero Linux experience, no prior history with cybersecurity except for making strong passwords, and joining because a friend wanted to partner up with me. Ultimately, that decision would lead me to the National Finals, as part of one of 12 best non-military affiliated high schools (aka Open Divison) teams, almost three years down the line (with that same friend!). It's one of my favorite experiences from my high school years. This memento is solely here to cherish that experience (as several others will be for coressponding experiences).</p>
<h2 id="making-it-there">Making It There</h2>
<p>Making it to the National Finals was quite the convoluted process. To make it, one must pass through four rounds, each more complex than the last. First came the generically named &quot;Round 1&quot; and &quot;Round 2&quot;. The top 30% or so of these teams make it to the &quot;Platinum Divison&quot;; these teams go on to participate in the &quot;State Round&quot;, which is not unlike the first two rounds, except significantly more difficult. The top 25% of those teams within the Platinum Division eventually go on to participate in &quot;Platinum Semifinals&quot;. From here, it's all or nothing; only the top 12 teams make it to the Finals (out of the hundreds still remaining). </p>
<p>Semifinals is a whole different beast from the other three rounds. In addition to the standard fare from the other rounds (but again, more difficult) there was an extra web challenge and Boeing-sponsored image to be completed, within the same time frame. An interesting quirk is that in my third (and final) year, the competition was changed to be 4 hours instead of 6 hours, adding even more extra-fun stress to a round known for time crunch. Yet it is in this environment where my team succeeded.</p>
<p>One of the worst (or best) parts of Semifinals is what happens after: waiting for scores. I distinctly remember the sheer level of speculation that occured; spreadsheets upon spreadsheets to created which teams might make it. There was the feeling of despair after underperforming during the image portion of the competition; the boost of confidence after receiving solid scores on the web and Boeing challenges; the heart attack of a low Cisco score when our packet tracer wasn't graded correctly; and finally, the feeling of triumph after realizing - we had done it.</p>
<p>I distinctly remember that day; the last updated (and eventually final) scores were released on February 1st. This was also the day of the AIME (my last one!). I received the text message from one of my teammates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are 9th </p>
— <cite>smashmaster, a very ecstatic Windows teammate<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that moment, three years of studying Linux in and out, crafting a checklist that always seemed to be missing something, and two seasons of lofty goals ending in disappointing results, seemed completely worth it. </p>
<p>As it happened, my Linux partner was with me. We celebrated together for a brief moment before heading our seperate ways for the rest of the school day.</p>
<h2 id="the-nats-experience">The Nats Experience</h2>
<p>First off, I got to miss two days of school. That's always pretty awesome. Second, I got to travel to Washington D.C., which I had never been to before, so that was also really cool. Obviously, the actual competition was at the forefront of everyone's mind, but there were other special experiences that I'll never forget:</p>
<p>I'll never forget stressing about Cisco and gameplanning the OS with my teammates, or the boba run we had after the competition, or playing Super Smash Bros in a hotel room after that boba run, or blogging the entire trip. I'll never forget meeting the people, that, until the Finals, I had only known through the CyberPatriot Discord (shoutout to Matt). I'll never forget about being known as part of the team notorious for cat ears, a tradition that I don't quite know the origin of. And of course, I'll never forget the excitement of even getting to participate in this contest in the first place, and captaining one of the best teams in the nation.</p>
<p>In the end, we didn't end up going on that stage and collecting a trophy. There are a few members on my team who have the opportunity to try again. No pressure. However, I'm happy with our results; we put forth our best effort, especially given that we were down a member, and I'm happy for what we've accomplished.</p>

<p><em>Picture taken after completing the contest. I am holding the blahaj.</em></p>
<p>Other highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fancy van to and from hotel. This was very nice.</li>
<li>Having my lip bleed by the end of the trip because it was so freaking cold, even in March.</li>
<li>Calling Abraham Lincoln a homie at his memorial.</li>
<li>Having a picture of myself (solo) at 6 in the morning <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/airforceassociation/53592906341/in/album-72177720315490722/">grabbing breakfast.</a></li>
<li>Visiting the D.C. area in general! We visited the Smithsonian, saw Congress, the Washington Memorial, the National Mall, WW2 memorial, and a lot of other cool government building and landmarks.</li>
<li>Fire banquet at the end of the competition.</li>
<li>Wearing cat ears!</li>
<li>Watching teammates engage in degenerate activities (Brawl Stars)</li>
<li>Being team captain :) and taking the competitor's oath in front of hundreds</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tips-for-cyberpatriot-people">Tips for CyberPatriot People</h2>
<p>Although I highly doubt any CyberPatriot competitors will come close to stumbling upon my website, I'll still leave tips here regardless (as part of my legacy I suppose).</p>
<p>First off, I highly recommending reading <a href="https://akshayrohatgi.com/blog/posts/How-To-Win-CyberPatriot/">hypernova's guide to winning CyberPatriot</a>. He's much more experienced than I am, and his guide helped me get into the right mindset heading into semifinals. </p>
<p>However, here are some high level tips for anyone hoping to do well:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's more important to focus on knowing your OS <em>well</em>. Being able to adapt to any scenario on your computer is better than simply memorizing &quot;where the points are at&quot;.</li>
<li>Baselining is a highly important and useful method to use, especially with a shorter timespan. This means messing around on a &quot;secure&quot; system and comparing it to your competition image, using tools.</li>
<li>Scripting is pretty overrated, unless you can be <em>absolutely sure</em> that it will work every single time. Otherwise, it might actually take you longer to run your script compared to doing everything manually.</li>
<li>Make sure to focus on the web challenge and Boeing images, and Cisco is crucial. Everyone focuses on the images a lot, for good reason, but in semifinals the other components are worth half the total available, and are often easier to score. Focus on them.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck to anyone hoping to make Nats!</p>
